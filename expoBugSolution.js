The solutions to uncommon Expo CLI errors are highly context-dependent, depending on the exact error message.  However, the general troubleshooting steps outlined in the bug report are a good starting point.  Let's illustrate with a hypothetical scenario:

**Scenario:**  Suppose you encounter an error message related to missing or corrupt native modules. This could indicate a problem during the build process for iOS or Android.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Clean the project:** Remove the `ios` and `android` folders within your project directory. These folders contain native project builds and may contain corrupt or outdated files.  
2. **Re-install native dependencies:** Run `expo prebuild` to ensure native modules are downloaded and configured correctly.
3. **Rebuild the project:** Run `expo start` to start the development server and let it rebuild the native projects.
4. **Check build logs:** Examine the logs generated during the build process for any more specific error messages.
5. **Consider upgrading:** Make sure your Expo CLI and Node.js versions are up-to-date.

**Code Example (Illustrative):**  This isn't specific code to fix the error, but rather to show a standard project setup:

```javascript
// expoBug.js (Example project file)
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js (Illustrative fix for native module issue â€“ might not directly apply)
// ... (Clean and rebuild steps as detailed above)...
```

Remember to always check the specific error message and consult the Expo documentation for detailed instructions related to that particular issue.
